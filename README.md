# Ticket-System
Calculate average grades for homework, recitation, and course

Calculate and display the user's homework average, their test average, and their final course percentage.
Print these values out to two decimal places.
Use either a switch statement or an if/else if block to determine what letter grade the user earned
based on their final course grade percentage. See the course syllabus for the letter grade breakdowns.
